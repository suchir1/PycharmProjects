MILLIONS OF AMERICAN LIVES COULD BE AT STAKE AS NORTH KOREA THREATENS TO ATTACK POWER GRID

Risk analyst and policy expert Dennis Santiago observed that any effort to harden the U.S. power grid — including the oldest and most interconnected portions of it in the eastern United States, which are especially exposed to disruption due to their age and design — have fallen short at the public utilities level because of “more pressing threats like physical attack security and cybersecurity.”

"Although Pompeo did not explicitly state that regime change is on the table, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) stated that his remarks “have gone over the line, and it has now become clear that the ultimate aim of the Trump Administration … is the regime change.”

Therefore, the North Korean news agency warned that even “the slightest sign of attempt to remove our supreme leadership” will lead to a “merciless blow” with its “powerful nuclear hammer.”

Pompeo, however, barely alluded to regime change in an interview where he focused on the importance of “separating” the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un from his burgeoning nuclear arsenal.","['Pompeo', 'Korean Central News Agency', 'the Trump Administration', 'North Korean', 'Pompeo', 'North Korean', 'Kim Jong']","['Pompeo', 'Kim Jong']","['Korean Central News Agency', 'the Trump Administration']",[],['Pompeo'],"['Pompeo', 'change', 'Agency', 'remarks', 'it', 'become', 'aim', ',', 'agency', 'sign', 'Pompeo', ',', 'he']","['did', 'state', 'is', 'stated', 'have', 'gone', 'has', 'become', 'is', 'warned', 'remove', 'will', 'lead', 'alluded', 'focused', 'separating', 'burgeoning']","['table', 'line', 'Administration', 'that', 'attempt', 'leadership', 'a', 'blow', 'hammer', 'change', 'interview', 'importance', 'regime', 'Un', 'arsenal']",0.8481,0.097,0.885,0.018,,2017-07-25 00:00:00, Korea threatens nuclear attack after claiming Trump CIA director 'shakes little fists' at regime

"And he said the CIA is working on a “wide range of options” to deal with the threat, and “those answers will be delivered almost certainly alongside our partners at the Department of Defense.”

"“As for the regime, I'm hopeful we will find a way to separate that regime from this system.”

The North Korean news agency said those remarks demonstrate Pompeo’s “illiteracy” about North Korea and “an explicit illustration of incompetence of the U.S. intelligence community.” It then went on to threaten Pompeo directly, saying he will “bitterly experience catastrophic and miserable consequences” by daring to shake his “little fists” at the Kim regime.","['North Korean', 'Pompeo’s', 'North Korea', 'U.S.', 'Pompeo', 'Kim']","['Pompeo’s', 'Kim']",[],[],"['North Korea', 'U.S.', 'Pompeo']","['I', 'we', 'agency', 'remarks', 'It', 'he', 'miserable']","[""'m"", 'will', 'find', 'separate', 'said', 'demonstrate', 'went', 'threaten', 'saying', 'will', '“', 'daring', 'shake']","['regime', 'way', 'regime', 'system', 'Korea', 'incompetence', 'community', 'Pompeo', 'experience', 'consequences', 'fists', 'regime']",-0.6249,0.105,0.73,0.165,2017-09-29 00:00:00,2017-07-25 00:00:00, Korea threatens nuclear attack after claiming Trump CIA director 'shakes little fists' at regime

"Thus, Kim has taken what Pompeo believes are “rational” responses to the uptick in threat posture from the U.S. military such as reaching out for help from South Korea’s new president to “get us to back off and stop pressing just as hard as he is.”

“You can certainly characterize that as a rational response to the threat he perceives from the U.S. and our allies,” said Pompeo, “Kim is certainly capable of responding to things that are in his regime’s best interest.”
